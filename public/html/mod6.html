      <p><b>Monster Data</b></p>

<p>
Monster data begins at offset <b>96C70 (95C08)</b> in Diablo.
In Hellfire, it's <b>AA8F0</b>.
<br>
<br>
Each monster is 128 bytes in length each, which is 8 full lines
in a hex editor. Place your cursor at the beginning of a monster
and drag it along until you see this at the very bottom &quot;Sel
0x80&quot;. This is one monster.</p>

turn them back on, go to <b>9A4F0 (99488)</b>. Here, you'll see
a bunch of 00's, 01's, and 02's. 00 means that slot is turned off,
while 01 and 02 means the slot is on. The difference between 01
and 02 are unknown. To find out what the slot number is, just
start from the first byte and count it as 0, and go up till you
get to the slot you want.<br>
<br>
Hellfire is a bit different.<br>
<br>
Go to offset <b>AF058</b> for the table. Here, each
slot is 4 bytes in length each, instead of just one in Diablo.
The same thing goes here as it did in Diablo, just count up each
one in 4 byte blocks.</p>
