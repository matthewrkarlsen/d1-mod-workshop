<p>This site contains information for the fundamentals on how to create your own Diablo or Hellfire Mod.

Thanks go out to Charlie, who originally wrote this workshop, and Jarulf, for his assistance in the original writing of the workshop. And thanks to Vector who gave us the suggestion of hosting this workshop.
<br>
<br>
Most of the text in this workshop is copied directly from Charlie's pages, so when it says something like "ask me" you can ask us (Zamal & Zenda), but it's not sure we know the answer. We have added some Hellfire information of our own, as that's what we know best.
<br>
<br>
        To make the modifications you will need a hex editor. We would suggest 
        Hex Workshop, and the homepage for it is <a
href="http://www.bpsoft.com/" target="blank">here</a>.<br>
        If you want to take your modmaking one step further you'll need a disassembler 
        like W32Dasm, which can be downloaded <a
href="http://www.expage.com/page/w32dasm" target="blank">here</a>.
<br>
       
<br>
The file offsets for the datatables of Diablo 1.09 have been added between brackets. For calculation of the memory offsets the same values are used as in Diablo 1.07
<br>
<br>
If you plan to move the townspeople of Tristram around, take a look at the <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~a3n/ASCIIMapofTown.html" target="_blank">Townmap</a> made by Dr. Zed.
<br>
<br>
Due to the fact that it cannot be downloaded from his own site, the latest MPQ file for DZM mod by Dr. Zed (10 Mb) is available <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~a3n/DZMod-Playtest-MPQ.zip" target="_blank">here</a>. 
<br>
<br>
For any modmaking enthusiast who is interested we have put together a file with all the notes we made creating our own mod. These notes are unsorted and some will contain incorrect information, especially the old ones. Some of these notes will contain Dutch comment but mostly it will be English. Anyone who feels up to the challenge of going through them can get them <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~a3n/DarkModNotes.zip" target="_blank">here</a>.
