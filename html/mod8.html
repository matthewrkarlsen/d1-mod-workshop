      <p><b>Shrine Data</b>
<p>

<p>
Shrine data begins at <b>9F6F0 (9E67F)</b> in Diablo, <b>8F170</b>
in Hellfire. <br>
<br>
First off is the list of <b>name pointers</b>. To
change the shrine names, follow the pointers to the name, and
edit it. Some names are shared with other things, such as the
Hidden Shrine.<br>
<br>
There will be a one byte seperator after the pointers and a list
of 01's. These are the starting dungeon levels of the shrine
slots. As you can see, all of the shrines can appear in level one.<br>
<br>
After that, you'll see a 6 byte seperator and a listing of 10's (Diablo)
or 18's (Hellfire) with an 8 in the Diablo data somewhere. This
is...you guessed it, the maximum dungeon level the shrine slots
can be found in. In Diablo, the Enchanted Shrine can appear up to
level 8 only, thus it has an 8 for it's slot. Why they have up to
16 (10 in hex, Diablo) is unknown, since shrines do not appear
there).<br>
<br>
And lastly, after another 6 byte seperator, you'll see another
listing of 00's, 01's, and 02's. 00 means the shrine at that
particular slot can appear in both SP and MP. 01 means the shrine
appears in SP only, and an 02 means the shrine only appears in MP.
